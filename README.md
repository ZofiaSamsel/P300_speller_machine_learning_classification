# P300_speller_machine_learning_classification

Project based on the BCI Challenge @ NER 2015 (https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/inria-bci-challenge/data)

“The “P300-Speller” is a well-known brain-computer interface (BCI) paradigm which uses Electroencephalography (EEG) and the so-called P300 response evoked by rare and attended stimuli in order to select items displayed on a computer screen. In this experiment, each subject was presented with letters and numbers (36 possible items displayed on a matrix) to spell words. Each item of a word is selected one at a time, by flashing screen items in group and in random order. The selected item is the one for which the online algorithm could most likely recognize the typical target response. 

The goal of this challenge is to determine when the selected item is not the correct one by analyzing the brain signals after the subject received feedback.”
